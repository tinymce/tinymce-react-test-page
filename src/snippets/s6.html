<!--
  This is where we define our placeholder. It can be any HTMl.
  The content is actually being inserted into the editor, but
  is filtered out on save/export to avoid it being submitted to
  the backend.
  Each button also has content editable false to make the button
  clickable.
  Please have a look at the CSS below as it's a big part of the
  UI as well.
  Notice also that we're not using any javascript inside the content
  to avoid XSS vulnerability issues. Instead each button is identified
  using an id.
